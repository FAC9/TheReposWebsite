![Wireframe](https://github.com/FAC9/TheReposWebsite/blob/master/New%20Mockup%201.png)


## WHY

The main goal of our website is to create an online space for our team "The REPOS". The secondary aim of our site is to direct people towards the Founders and Coders website. 

## WHAT

A simple, interactive and single-page website hosted on GitHub Pages. Our aim is to help the user easily navigate the website by either using the navigation bar, linked buttons or by scrolling down the page. 

## HOW

Our approach is mobile-first design, we have striped all of the unnecessary features that might have been included if we were designing for desktop-first. We are basing the design on a CSS grid system.

## Work Plan
  - Agree on our group name
  - Research different group blogs and websites
  - brainstorm and discuss design ideas and functionality 
  - create wireframe
  - create all of the master files and directories on GitHub.
  - start coding the grid.
  - code each page
